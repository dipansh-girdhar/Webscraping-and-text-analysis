They train former street kids in the hospitality industry and help them find employment after they complete the training. That was a good enough reason for us to eat here. We were here mid afternoon so it was quiet. We were greeted by a lovely young lady and taken to our table. We enjoyed butter chicken and a bread basket and the food was delicious. Service was quick and friendly. It is partway down a long shopping street and we struggled a bit to find it but people along the way seemed to know it so we were easily directed. Worth a visit not because it’s the most spectacular place but because this type of work needs to be supported.

We ordered the Dahl, butter chicken, rice, naan and two lime sodas. It was all delicious. 1200 rupees for two people so on the more expensive side for Delhi but it is a more western style tourist restaurant if you are just getting your bearings in Delhi it is a nice place to go. I heard it is operated by G adventures but can’t confirm for sure. I liked the cause behind the restaurant as well. Service was great. When we were there (only two of us) a group of tourists came in and asked for a table for 16 which they accommodated so it is good for larger groups as well. "

Like many other westerners who have reviewed this restaurant, we also went there for dinner because we thought the place was doing some good. The food took ages to arrive, was overpriced and not to local standards- more like Tesco packaged food that the western palate is used to. Especially the Shahi paneer which was full of sugar and red colouring. It had no cashew paste, traditional spices or ghee. I grew up locally so I should know what authentic food tastes like. We did not pay for it as we could not eat (but this took some convincing). My hakka noodles were okay, though the other paneer we ordered was to give my son stomach problems in the morning. The ambience was poor with bad acoustics- some timber palettes hung from the ceiling which obviously the designer of the restaurant had seen in some trendy Western restaurant but in this case, had been specially made!!! As an architect, I though the layout was very poor. There was a family getting drunk and making a lot of noise but the manager was too timid to stop them. But more worryingly, we did not get proper answers about their charitable cause. We were told that they supported street kids but I did not see a charity registration number. We did not see any street kids there and their first 'intern' who has given an interview on their facebook page doesn't give any details of what he learned. He doesn't appear to a be street kid, but a well educated adult. I talked to some street kinds in the area and they had never heard of this restaurant and neither had the local business association. We never went there again but instead visited the authentic South Indian restaurant next door (we also saw some of KWAC staff there!). Daily we watched hordes of naive western people going there, thinking they were helping the poor by eating the terrible overpriced food. You might be better off giving the money to a registered charity and eating authentic food somewhere else instead."

We were taken there by our tour guide as a last night meal and the food was sublime. There were 12 of us all with different dishes and every one agreed the food, ambiance and service was excellent. I was a bit unwell and wanted a fairly bland meal. The menu showed a chicken tikka dish with a creamy sauce but I asked for a 'plain' chicken tikka. The chicken was beautifully cooked - soft and tender and with just the right amount of seasoning and spices to be acceptable for a dodgy tummy. The peas pilau rice and garlic naan accompaniment were also very flavoursome. I just wish we had gone there on our previous visit to Delhi as I should have liked to have tried some of the other interesting dishes on the menu. The staff are all very sweet and nothing was too much trouble. I urge you to give this place a try - but suggest a booking as it is very popular and reasonably priced."

My wife and I have just spent 3 weeks on our first tour in India, although we are seasoned Asia travellers. We commenced and ended our tour with 3 independent days in Karol Bagh where we discovered this little gem. It’s clean, friendly and the food is great. Bonus for us was their non-veg selection which was varied enough for us to try a different dish each evening. Portions are large and we probably could have got away with one meal between the two of us, but we didn’t! Service was excellent particularly given some of the staff were learning the ropes, but of course that’s what it’s all about. Whilst we were away on our tour the restaurant got it’s liquor licence so it was an added bonus that upon return to New Delhi we could have a beer with our meal. Can get busy but we are early eaters (6pm) on the road and found that we were able to get table without booking. Give it a go, you won’t be sorry, and well done to the owners and manager.

Easily accessible on foot, by rickshaw or Tuk-Tuk. A 10/15 minute walk from the Karol Bagh metro station. I have eaten here several times, both solo and with a group, and never been disappointed. The place is simply furnished, bright and clean. The menu offers a variety of Indian and Asian fare, both vegetarian and meat based, with some vegan options, augmented with some pizza and pasta alternatives. There are always adequate staff, the service is courteous, professional and fairly prompt. I can personally recommend the Naan and the vegetarian curries. Expect to pay between INR 500 and INR 850 per person, including a drink, tax and tip. "
